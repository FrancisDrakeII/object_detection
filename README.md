## Virtual Environment creation
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. Sort of like your house has kitchen, bedroom, bathroom... and each room is meant for each specific activity.  
1. Download and install Anaconda for windows https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual   


## This website gives you the tested build configurations for windows OS. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows 
For tensorflow-gpu-1.13.x version, the compatible Python version is 3.5-3.7, cuDNN is 7.4 and CUDA is 10. There are lots of Python Complier/IDE right now, if you are using MSVC, please follow the corresponding Complier version. 

## CUDA and cuDNN installation 
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and API that allows software to use certain types of GPU for general purpose. Here's the download site https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit. Make sure you select the compatible version.   
cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library primitives for deep neural networks. Here's the download site https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-download-survey Make sure you select the compatible version.
