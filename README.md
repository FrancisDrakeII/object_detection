# I highly recommend using the NVIDIA series GPU for training. And this introduction is based on the premise that you own a NVIDIA series GPU. This repo used tensorflow-gpu-1.13.2! 

## This website gives you the tested build configurations for windows OS. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows 
For tensorflow-gpu-1.13.x version, the compatible Python version is 3.5-3.7, cuDNN is 7.4 and CUDA is 10. There are lots of Python Complier/IDE right now, if you are using MSVC, please follow the corresponding Complier version. 

## CUDA and cuDNN installation 
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and API that allows software to use certain types of GPU for general purpose. Here's the download site https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit. Make sure you select the compatible version.   
cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library primitives for deep neural networks. Here's the download site https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-download-survey Make sure you select the compatible version.
